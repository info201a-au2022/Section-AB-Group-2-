# The Average NBA height   


### `Abstract`
Our main question is does height affect your chances of making it to the NBA? With this question we will keep in mind the heights of past and current NBA players along with their stats to be able to compare the correlation between height and performance. We will be looking at many numbers in order to do so, such as player stats, to be able to see if there is a correlation between height and the chances of making it into the NBA.




### `Keywords`

- Height

- Basketball

- Performance

- Opportunity


### `Introduction`
While all sports have their physical requirements, in the NBA, height is one of the key physical requirements for players in any position. Height not only gives basketball players an advantage in terms of shooting but also helps defensive players keep the ball out of the hoop.

We will be analyzing the increase in average height in the NBA, and how it affects other potential basketball players from achieving their dreams of becoming professional NBA basketball players.

### `Problem Domain`

With the popularity basketball, and the success of NBA commercialization, the NBA is getting more and more attention. Many young people want to become professional basketball players, but there are no quantitative criteria to assess whether they can be a basketball player. We hope to collect and compile the height and weight of NBA players over the past 20 years and observe the changes. Direct stakeholder is someone who wishes to become a basketball player. The possible benefit is to help them determine their career direction earlier. The possible disadvantage is that the transparency may increase the competition in the NBA draft. But it also helps the viewers, the indirect stakeholder, because they can see a more watchable game.

### `Research Questions`

_Question 1_

>Does height affect one's chances of making it to the NBA? This question is important because it will show how over the years the “standard” height to play basketball professionally has changed. With this I can include in my data “height” as a variable to measure.

_Question 2_

>How tall are some of the best NBA players? This question motivates me to make a data set of player stats with their height to be able to see a correlation between height and performance while playing basketball. This data can include normal NBA averages such as points, blocks, steals, rebounds and many more.

_Question 3_

>What is the average NBA height? This question is very important as it can quickly answer our question if there is a correlation between height and chances of playing in the NBA and we can compare these averages to other leagues to see if perhaps players didn't make it to the top league due to their height.


### `Research Questions`
We used the NBA database, which stores physical data of all players from 1996-2021, including height and weight. Because we study NBA players, this database is very helpful to us. Using the NBA database also improves the accuracy and authority of our data. Looking at only the height and weight of rookie players over a 5-year period would not be enough to show changes. the NBA's large database also increases our data sample size in order to observe changes in the data.

### `Expected Implications`
Some implications that a technologist can make is that the player with the better stats may be the ideal height for a good basketball player as in our data it will show how good a player was state wise along with their height being the independent variable. Designers might come up with an idea to display this data of correlation between height and basketball skill in the best way possible as they will most likely imply that these numbers may not be fully coordinated and rather more scattered. Finally a policy maker that would make an implication can be such as any basketball organization, not only the NBA. With these questions and Data they may have to ask “Should there be a minimum height to play in this league” as certain leagues may find this as a way to become more competitive if the league is full of taller men.

### `Limitations`
Some limitations that came to mind while deciding on our topic were limited sample sizes, lack of reliable data or self-reported data (I.e. non-credible source), and potential deficiencies in the measurements of the data. The reason this can be a limitation is because of our topic/issue, with it already being somewhat broad, we may find issues in where questionnaires for the data lack to address a specific issue. In this case, our issue on how height has affected an athletes chance of making it into the NBA.
